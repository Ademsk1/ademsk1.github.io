My name is Adam, I'm a software engineer, and have been passionate about all things hacky and techy since I can remember. I have a Physics background, but simulating and modelling was the source of a lot of my joy (and frustration). I am now a co-founder of Llongterm, a memory-solution for LLM-based conversations. 

I've been a bit of a lay-about this last year in finding joy in coding. I fear that corporate jobs can do that to you. So I've started this blog with the intention to regain my curiosity by creating small projects and documenting them here, alongside the general movement of LLM's and where I think we're heading.
